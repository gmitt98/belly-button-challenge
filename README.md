# belly-button-challenge

This repository contains a dashboard for viewing data from the "Belly Button Biodiversity dataset". The dashboard is publicly deployed here:
https://gmitt98.github.io/belly-button-challenge/

The repo contains the following folders and files:

* "Images" folder: images associated with the project, including examples of what charts should look like.
* "data" folder: currently contains a copy of the samples.json that we use. The dashboard pulls data from a URL, this is just a copy.
* "static" folder: contains "js" folder that holds our JavaScript app
* index.html: the webpage for the dashboard linked above
* README file


The dashboard is built in JavaScript using Plotly.
