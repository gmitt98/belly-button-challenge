The repo contains the following folders and files:

* "Images" folder: images associated with the project, including examples of what charts should look like.
* "data" folder: currently contains a copy of the samples.json that we use. The dashboard pulls data from a URL, this is just a copy.
* "static" folder
* "js" folder
